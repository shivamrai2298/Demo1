Part A
(1) Average time he leaves the shop
Shop closes at 9 PM (21:00).
Last customer arrives before 9 PM, so average last arrival ≈ 9 PM.
Average service time = 4 minutes per customer.
He leaves around 9:04 PM.


(2)
Wq​=λE[S^2] / 2(1−ρ)​
ρ=λE[S],E[S2]=σ2+(E[S])2
ρ=0.0714×4=0.2856
E[S2]=1.52+42=2.25+16=18.25

Wq​=0.0714×18.25​ / 2(1−0.2856)
  =1.42881.302
  ​=0.911 minutes
W=Wq​+E[S]=0.911+4=4.911 minutes
